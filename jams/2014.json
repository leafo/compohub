            "description": "What is TAG - The Arbitrary Gamejam?\r\nI created TAG to try and add something exciting and good natured to the community. \r\nThe Arbitrary Gamejam is a weekend game jam with 3 themes designed to promote small and unknown indie developers.\r\nAt the end of each TAG, the submissions are rated by the host.\r\nThe person who submitted the best game will be \"tagged\" and is responsible for hosting the next TAG.\r\nThe idea is, as the Gamejam grows more popular, passing the Gamejam around will help small unknown indie developers pull traffic to their websites.\r\nBy using a random word generator to generate 2/3 themes, TAG is intentionally arbitrary to encourage outside-the-box thinking and wild combinations.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen is TAG?\r\nTAG usually occurs on the first weekend of every month, Friday to Sunday.\r\nThe themes for each TAG will be posted on the Thursday before it starts, to give people some time to think about how the themes can fit together.\r\nThe Jam Begins at Midnight on Thursday and Ends at Midnight on Sunday.\r\n\r\n[Go to the Current Hosts site for a Countdown to the next TAG]\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Do I Host?\r\nFirst and foremost, you cannot host TAG twice in a row or more than two times in a single year (Unless yours is the only submission). If you end up hosting TAG, you can handle it in any way you want under two conditions.\r\nYou must keep the 4 core rules outlined below by linking to this page. This maintains the legitimacy of the jam by identifying you officially as current host and prevents non-tagged people from hosting.\r\nThere must be 2 randomly generated themes, the last theme is chosen by you.\r\nOther than that you are free to decide how people join and how submissions are rated/handled, and any further rules/restrictions you want to place on participants.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe 4 Core Rules\r\nSubmissions must come in within 12 hours of the Gamejam ending.\r\nSubmissions must be original works, no plagiarism.\r\nSubmissions can be based on any number of themes, but must incorporate at least 1 of the randomly generated themes.\r\nNo Pressure. Just have fun with it. Submissions will still be accepted even if they're not complete.\r\n- - -\r\n\r\nTAG History\r\n\r\nA List of all previous TAGs, their hosts and their entries.\r\n\r\n#01 - August 2013 - Hosted by TickTakashi\r\n[Games]\r\n\r\n#02 - September 2013 - Hosted by Udell Games\r\n[Games]\r\n\r\n#03 - October 2013 - Hosted by Brendan LoBuglio\r\n[Not Yet Started]\r\n\r\n[TAG #03 Begins on October 11th]",

Part of the reason they're everywhere is that they're both well known and free to use, and a lot of people who make games aren't aware of just how many good stories they're carrying around with them. There are SO MANY other stories and characters out there that are also free to use. The list goes on forever, and these are all stories that are free to be remixed and remade by anyone.
